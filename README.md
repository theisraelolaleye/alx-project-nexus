### Documenting My Learning Journey — *ProDev Front-End Engineering Programme*

---

## 📘 Overview

The **ALX ProDev Front-End Engineering Programme** is an **8-month** intensive, hands-on training designed to equip learners with **advanced frontend and mobile development skills**. It combines **professional foundations**, **cutting-edge technologies**, and **real-world projects** to prepare learners for high-impact roles in tech such as **Frontend Developer**, **Mobile Developer**, or **UI/UX Specialist**.

The journey begins with the **Professional Foundations module (3 months)**, which develops essential workplace meta-skills — followed by **5 months of advanced frontend specialization** focusing on tools and frameworks like **React, Next.js, React Native, TypeScript**, and **GraphQL**.

## 🧗 Challenges Faced & Solutions Implemented

| Challenge | Solution |
|------------|-----------|
| Mastering TypeScript in React | Gradually introduced types, used interfaces & generics, refactored progressively. |
| State management complexity | Used Context API for lightweight cases and Redux Toolkit for global state. |
| Performance bottlenecks | Applied lazy loading, dynamic imports, and image optimization in Next.js. |
| Security vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) | Sanitized inputs, used HTTP-only cookies, and implemented validation. |
| Team collaboration during capstone | Used Git branching strategy, pull requests, and code reviews. |
